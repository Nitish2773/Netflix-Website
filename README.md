**Netflix Website**

Netflix Website is a static website project designed to mimic the user experience and interface of popular movie streaming services like Netflix. This project focuses on creating a visually appealing 
and responsive web platform using only front-end technologies, without the need for server-side scripting or databases.Key technologies used in this project include HTML for structuring the content,
CSS for styling and layout. Popular front-end libraries and frameworks such as Bootstrap are utilized to enhance responsiveness and design consistency. Additionally, the project demonstrates 
the use of modern web development practices like Flexbox or CSS Grid for layout, and media queries for a responsive design that adapts to various screen sizes.
